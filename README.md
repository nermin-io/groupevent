# Groupevent
Groupevent is a free tool that makes creating and managing invites for personal events easy.

## Motivation
In this digital era, there are many ways to plan events and send invites, for example: WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Postal Service and more.
With the exception for Postal Service, you can't guarantee that all of your invitees will be on the platform.

Groupevent was created to use emails to create and manage invites. 
It is one of the most primitive forms of internet communication and the majority of users on the internet have an existing email address.

The vision is to build on top of only email, so requiring users to sign up to a new service is out of the question.
Similarly, marketing to users will also be avoided to keep the tool free and honest.
